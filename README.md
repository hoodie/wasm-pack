This tool seeks to be a one-stop shop for building and working with rust-
generated WebAssembly that you would like to interop with JavaScript, in the
browser or with Node.js. `wasm-pack` helps you build and publish rust-generated
WebAssembly to the npm registry to be used alongside any other javascript
package in workflows that you already use, such as [webpack] or [greenkeeper].

## üîÆ Prerequisities

- [Development Environment](docs/prerequisites.md)
- [Installation and Getting Started](docs/setup.md)

## üéôÔ∏è Commands

- [`init`](docs/src/init.md): Generate an npm wasm pkg from a rustwasm crate
- [`build`](docs/src/build.md): Generate an npm wasm pkg from a rustwasm crate
- [`pack` and `publish`](docs/pack-and-publish.md): Create a tarball of your rustwasm pkg and/or publish to a registry

## üìù Logging

We generate a `wasm-pack.log` file if `wasm-pack` errors on you, and you can
customize the log verbosity using the verbosity flag.

| Verbosity     | Result                                              |
| ------------- |-----------------------------------------------------|
| -v            | All Info, Warn, and Errors are logged               |
| -vv           | All Debug, Info, Warn, and Errors are logged        |
| -vvv          | All Trace, Debug, Info, Warn, and Errors are logged |

## ‚ö° Quickstart Guide

1. Write a crate in Rust.
2. Add `wasm-bindgen` to your `Cargo.toml`:

  ```toml
  [lib]
  crate-type = ["cdylib"]

  [dependencies]
  wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
  ```
3. Add this to the top of your `src/lib.rs`:

  ```rust
  #![feature(use_extern_macros)]

  extern crate wasm_bindgen;

  use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
  ```

4. Annotate your public functions with `#[wasm_bindgen]`, for example:

  ```rust
  #[wasm_bindgen]
  extern {
      pub fn alert(s: &str);
  }

  #[wasm_bindgen]
  pub fn greet(name: &str) {
      alert(&format!("Hello, {}!", name));
  }
  ```

5. Install this tool: `cargo install wasm-pack`
6. Run `wasm-pack build`, optionally, pass a path to a dir or a scope (see above for details)
7. This tool generates files in a `pkg` dir
8. To publish to npm, run `wasm-pack publish`. You may need to login to the
  registry you want to publish to. You can login using `wasm-pack login`.
